For Dynamic component level permissions:
Using directives is not possible as it is not applicable for routed components.

checking permission in NgOnInit sounds good as it provides full control.


Permissions level thing in angular is just for not showing element on the UI. aany restricted element can be viewed by changing the value in the cookie/localstorage manually..

For blocked content the server must not send data.

Use a centralized service which component hits before getting loaded to see if it is to be shown or not.

the service must fetch component permissions from the database and thus can be modified dynamically
